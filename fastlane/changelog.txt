Thanks for everyone helping with testing!

Get ready for version 2.0 of the Habitica iOS app!

The apps internals have been completely reworked and rewritten, to allow for faster and easier development in the future and also fixing a lot of long standing issues.

New in this version:
- Sound effects!
- redesigned task form
- redesigned Equipment page
- redesigned Avatar Customization page
- redesigned guild and party page
- redesigned skills page
- redesigned stable
- redesigned class selection screen
- better display for when edits to tasks are still being synced
- Themes! You can now choose between 8 different themes for the app (Note that this feature might not be included in the final 2.0, since we are still experimenting with this)

Fixes:
- The duplicate items bug is finally gone for good!


Known issues in this build:
- The page that displays that you are currently not in a party does not work correctly
- "Session outdated" error notification can appear. In this case, please use pull-to-refresh on one of the task lists
- changing classes from settings menu doesn't work correctly

We're also trying out a new feedback/bug reporting tool called Instabug. If you want to report anything you can shake your device and then the Instabug popup will appear. For those bug reports, a screenshot is also automatically attached (you can edit/remove this if wanted).
