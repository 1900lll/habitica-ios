Thanks for everyone helping with testing!

This is the first build with iOS 13 support. The way dark themes work has been changed, so that every theme color now has a light and dark variant. On iOS 13, the light/dark follows the system setting. Dark mode currently is not avaialble on iOS 12 and a way to enable it there will be added in a future beta.
