# HabitRPG for iOS

Native iOS app for [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/).

## Setup for local development

We are using [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage dependencies. So in order to set up the project, you have to install cocoapods first.

	sudo gem install cocoapods

after that you can install the project dependencies.

	pod install
	
Now you can open the *HabitRPG.xcworkspace* file and hopefully everything works. (Do not use the *.xcodeproj* file anymore.)
